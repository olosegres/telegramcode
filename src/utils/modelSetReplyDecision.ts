/**
 * @description Pure reply-decision for the four `/model`-set paths in `bot.ts`
 * (the `/model <num>` and `/model <name>` commands, the text-handler numeric
 * pick, and the `model_<id>` button callback). All four asked the adapter to
 * set the model and now must build the SAME user-facing reply — so the branchy
 * decision lives here, unit-testable without the Telegraf machinery (same
 * pattern as `statusFlushDecision.ts`).
 *
 * The no-session decision itself now lives in the adapters (OpenCode persists
 * the pref and returns success; Claude refuses with a notice), so this helper
 * is purely about turning the adapter's outcome into a message — it does NOT
 * gate on session state itself.
 *
 * `isActive` only distinguishes the two SUCCESS copies: a live switch
 * (`model.set_success`) vs a pref saved for the next agent start
 * (`model.saved_for_next_start`). BOTH copies come from i18n, so a `translate`
 * callback is injected (callers pass `t`; tests pass a stub) to keep this module
 * free of the i18n import and trivially testable. The live copy used to be a
 * hardcoded English template literal — once the effort hint below was appended
 * to it, a non-English chat would have read an English headline above a
 * translated hint, so it moved into the catalog too.
 *
 * Both success copies carry the SHARED `effort.current_hint` block (the same key
 * the post-start `agent.ready` notice renders), so the level in force and the
 * "/effort to change it" pointer can never drift between the two messages. The
 * caller must resolve `effort` AFTER `setModel` returned: switching to a model
 * that does not offer the current level clears it (see
 * `effort.cleared_on_model_switch`), so a pre-switch read would name a level
 * that no longer applies.
 *
 * @name ModelSetReplyDecision
 * @description
 * - `unsupported` — the adapter has no `setModel`: nothing was changed.
 * - `error`       — `setModel` returned a non-null error string.
 * - success (`isOk: true`) — live switch or deferred-to-next-start save.
