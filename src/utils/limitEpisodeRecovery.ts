/**
 * @description Pure layer behind the boot recovery of a usage/session-limit
 * episode that ENDED BEFORE the bot restarted.
 *
 * An ARMED retry survives a restart on its own (`state.json` `apiRetries`,
 * re-armed after reattach). An UNRECOGNISED limit error leaves nothing behind —
 * so a topic whose agent died on a limit before the detector understood that
 * wording just sits there, and a bot update alone does not resume it. This module
 * reads the evidence the json-stream Claude backend leaves on disk (the terminal
 * `result` frame at the end of its `stdout.jsonl`) and decides whether the bot
 * should arm the limit wait itself.
 *
 * V1 IS JSON-STREAM ONLY, by evidence availability: the tmux-scrape backend keeps
 * its history only in a tmux pane (already repainted by adopt time) and OpenCode's
 * error lives in a transient SSE event, so neither has a comparable on-disk tail
 * to re-read. Those backends recover the normal way — the next live error fires
 * the detector.
 *
 * Only the decisions live here; the fs read and the `handleApiError` call stay in
 * `bot.ts` (the apiErrorRetry pure-layer / manager split).
