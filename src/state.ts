/**
 * @description On-disk state for the multi-thread telegram bot.
 *
 * Replaces the legacy `~/.telegram-bot-messages.json` (which only persisted
 * `messageIds` per user) with a richer per-`ThreadKey` schema:
 *
 *   - `bindings[key]`  → thread is attached to a subdir under `WORK_ROOT`
 *   - `agents[key]`    → which adapter the thread is using, model, session ids
 *   - `messages[key]`  → message ids tracked by `/clear`
 *
 * Schema source: plan §9. Field additions for D14 (`claudeSessionId`), §13.19
 * (`opencodeSessionId`) and D49 (`bindings[key].closed`) are inlined here.
 *
 * The file is rewritten atomically (`writeFile(tmp) → fsync(fd) → rename →
 * fsync(parentDir)`, plan §13.14, T4). Concurrent mutations to the same
 * `ThreadKey` are serialised by a per-key async lock (plan §13.15, E3).
 *
 * **This module is intentionally NOT yet imported from `bot.ts`.** Plan §11
 * Этап 2 wires state in only on the following commit (Этап 3) — keeping the
 * landing surgical.
