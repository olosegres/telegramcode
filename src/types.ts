/**
 * @description Unified interface for AI agent backends (Claude CLI, OpenCode, etc.).
 * Each adapter manages sessions keyed by `ThreadKey` and communicates via EventEmitter.
 *
 * Events emitted (all carry the `ThreadKey` as the first argument):
 * - 'output'   (key: ThreadKey, text: string, meta?: OutputEventMeta) — permanent text response
 * - 'status'   (key: ThreadKey, text: string)   — transient status (tool calls, thinking); shown as editable message
 * - 'question' (key: ThreadKey, question: { requestId: string, questions: QuestionInfo[] }) — interactive question for user
 * - 'questionGone' (key: ThreadKey) — Claude-only; the scraped TUI selector left the screen (answered / dismissed), so the bot removes its pin. Claude has no `pendingQuestions` entry, so it can't lean on the OpenCode `clearPendingQuestion` unpin path; this event is the normal-answer unpin trigger. Hard-teardown paths (stop / quit / unbind / closed / error) still route through `clearPendingQuestion` for BOTH backends.
 * - 'thinking' (key: ThreadKey, payload: ThinkingEvent) — chain-of-thought lifecycle (OpenCode); the bot applies the per-thread thinking {@link DisplayVerbosityMode}
 * - 'toolResult' (key: ThreadKey, payload: ToolResultEvent) — a completed tool call's output (OpenCode); the bot applies the per-thread tool-results {@link DisplayVerbosityMode}
 * - 'subagentStatus' (key: ThreadKey, payload: SubagentStatusEvent) — OpenCode delegation lifecycle for `minimal`/`short` `/subagent` modes; the bot owns a dedicated self-updating status message with a ticking elapsed timer
 * - 'apiError' (key: ThreadKey, error: AgentApiErrorClass) — provider-side API error at the proxy boundary (auto-retry trigger; only when {@link AgentApiErrorClass} classification matched)
 * - 'started'  (key: ThreadKey)                  — session is up and ready
 * - 'stopped'  (key: ThreadKey)                  — `stopSession` completed (explicit teardown)
 * - 'closed'   (key: ThreadKey)                  — session died on its own (process exit, SSE giveup, server crash)
 * - 'error'    (key: ThreadKey, error: Error)    — asynchronous failure AFTER successful startSession resolution
 *
 * Audit S10 / #16 contract clarifications (enforced by every adapter):
 *
 * - `startSession` / `resumeSession` rejects (throws) if the session
 *   could not be started or recovered. Successful resolution implies
 *   `checkIsActive(key) === true` and that subsequent events will fire.
 *
 * - `emit('error', …)` is for failures that happen AFTER a successful
 *   start (network blip, SSE drop with no recovery). Synchronous start
 *   failures must throw, never emit error+return.
 *
 * - `emit('closed', …)` is for unsolicited deaths only. If the user
 *   called `stopSession`, the adapter emits `stopped` instead. Both
 *   events MUST come with the same teardown (in-memory state freed).
