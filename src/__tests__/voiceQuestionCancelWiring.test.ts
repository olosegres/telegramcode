/**
 * @description S4 wiring guard — a voice transcript must reach the SAME
 * active-prompt choke point as a text message, so a question pending on the
 * thread is cancelled (free-form) or answered (bare digit) identically for both
 * inputs.
 *
 * Why a structural test (and not a behavioural one): the delivery functions live
 * in the side-effecting `bot.ts` entrypoint and depend on Telegram + download +
 * transcription I/O, so they cannot be exercised in isolation without standing
 * up the whole bot. The cancel DECISION itself is pure and exhaustively covered
 * in `openCodeQuestionFlow.test.ts` (`getQuestionReplyRoute`), and the cancel
 * WIRING is proven live on the test topic for TEXT. This guard locks the one
 * remaining seam that a live run can't drive (the `send_voice` MCP tool can't
 * target a forum topic): that `processVoiceJob`'s final delivery goes through
 * `deliverActivePrompt`, the shared choke point — NOT back to the bare
 * `forwardPromptToAgent` it used before S4, which would silently re-open the
 * "voice queues behind a blocked question" bug this change fixes.
 *
 * No Jira test-case issue is known for this change; recording the gap here per
 * `tests.md` § "Jira test-case reference" instead of inventing an id.
